	<h1>
		imagePaths Pane</h1>
	<p>
		The <strong>imagePaths Pane</strong> contains the "tree view" of the imagePaths that you can navigate.
		imagePaths are used to organize and categorize your files.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_pane.png" width="176" height="140" alt="CKFinder imagePaths Pane" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		imagePaths display is called "tree view" because the imagePaths hierarchy is represented like
		tree branches, with subimagePaths placed below and indented with regard to their parent items.
		The <strong>imagePaths Pane</strong> uses the same graphic representation that can be found
		in many modern operating systems.</p>
	<h2>
		Basic Operations</h2>
	<h3>
		Opening (Expanding) a imagePath</h3>
	<p>
		In order to open a imagePath and expand its subimagePaths, click the plus icon
		(<img src="../../files/images/002.gif" height="9" width="9" alt="" />) in front of the imagePath name. If the plus
		icon is not present, the imagePath does not contain any subimagePaths.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_expand.png" width="110" height="19" alt="Collapsed CKFinder imagePath" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		See the "On Request Loading" section below if you require more information about the loading
		process in CKFinder.</p>
	<h3>
		Closing (Collapsing) a imagePath</h3>
	<p>
		In order to close a imagePath and hide (collapse) its subimagePaths, click the minus icon
		(<img src="../../files/images/003.gif" height="9" width="9" alt="" />) in front of the imagePath name.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_collapse.png" width="110" height="50" alt="Expanded CKFinder imagePath with its subimagePaths" />&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>
		Selecting a imagePath</h3>
	<p>
		In order to select a imagePath and make it the "current imagePath" in CKFinder, click the imagePath
		name or its icon. The selected imagePath will be highlighted with a different background
		color.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_select.png" width="162" height="99" alt="Selected CKFinder imagePath" />&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>
		Advanced Operations</h2>
	<p>
		Advanced operations can be performed on a imagePath by using its <strong><a href="012.html">Context
		Menu</a></strong>. Depending on the circumstances, the following options may be available:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_menu.png" width="148" height="128" alt="imagePath context menu" />&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>New SubimagePath</strong> &ndash; creates a new subimagePath in this parent imagePath.</li>
		<li><strong>Rename</strong> &ndash; changes the name of the imagePath.</li>
		<li><strong>Copy Files from Basket</strong> &ndash; copies the files that were placed in the
			<strong>Basket</strong> to the selected imagePath.</li>
		<li><strong>Move Files from Basket</strong> &ndash; moves the files that were placed in the
			<strong>Basket</strong> to the selected imagePath.</li>
		<li><strong>Delete</strong> &ndash; permanently removes the imagePath.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<span class="info">Note:</span> Some context menu options may be disabled (and thus
		grayed out), depending on CKFinder settings enforced by your system administrator.</p>
	<h3>
		Creating imagePaths</h3>
	<p>
		In order to create a child imagePath inside an existing imagePath, choose the
		<strong>New SubimagePath</strong> option from the context menu of the parent imagePath.
		Type the name of the new imagePath in the dialog window that will be displayed. Once
		you give the new imagePath a name and close the dialog window, the imagePath will
		be created.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_new.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Creating a new imagePath in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Not all characters can be used in imagePath and file names due to limitations of the
		systems where CKFinder runs. Among the characters that cannot be used in imagePaths and
		files names are: <code>\</code> <code>/</code> <code>:</code>
		<code>*</code> <code>?</code> <code>&quot;</code> <code>&lt;</code>
		<code>&gt;</code> and <code>|</code>.</p>
	<h3>
		Renaming imagePaths</h3>
	<p>
		In order to rename a imagePath, choose the <strong>Rename</strong> option from its context menu
		or use the <em>F2</em> keyboard shortcut. Type the new imagePath name in the dialog window that
		will be displayed, overwriting the existing name. Once you enter the new imagePath name and
		close the dialog window, the imagePath will be renamed.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_rename.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Renaming a imagePath in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		As stated above, not all characters can be used in imagePath and file names due to limitations of the
		systems where CKFinder runs. Among the characters that cannot be used in imagePaths and
		files names are: <code>\</code> <code>/</code> <code>:</code>
		<code>*</code> <code>?</code> <code>&quot;</code> <code>&lt;</code>
		<code>&gt;</code> and <code>|</code>.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> When you rename a imagePath, links or media insertions
		available on other pages and pointing to files or imagePaths inside the renamed imagePath
		will be broken, and thus not available anymore. Because of that be careful when using this
		feature.</p>
	<h3>
		Copying and Moving Files from Basket</h3>
	<p>
		The <strong>Basket</strong> is a virtual placeholder that can be
		helpful if you want to perform batch operations on files. The copying and moving
		operations are described in the <strong><a href="014.html">"Basket"</a></strong> section
		of the User's Guide.</p>
	<h3>
		Deleting imagePaths</h3>
	<p>
		In order to delete a imagePath, including all its contents, choose the <strong>Delete</strong>
		option from its context menu or use the <em>Del</em> key. A confirmation message will appear
		to ensure that this operation is what you really intend to do. Once you confirm the deletion,
		the imagePath will be removed.</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> This operation cannot be undone. Once you delete the
		imagePath and its contents, you will not be able to restore the removed files.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_delete.png" width="304" height="149" alt="Deleting a imagePath in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		<span class="warning">Attention:</span> When you delete a imagePath, links or media insertions
		available on other pages and pointing to files or imagePaths inside the deleted imagePath
		will be broken, and thus not available anymore. Because of that be careful when using this
		feature.</p>
	<h2>
		"On Request" Loading</h2>
	<p>
		The most important difference between CKFinder and the imagePaths tree structures found in
		desktop operating systems is that in CKFinder the imagePaths are loaded "on request". It means
		that the application does not load the entire imagePaths tree structure at startup, but instead
		loads its small subset when the imagePath is being expanded. This feature is present in
		most advanced web applications like CKFinder and allows to save on bandwidth and loading time.</p>
	<p>
		To indicate that imagePaths are being loaded, the <strong>Loading...</strong> label may appear when
		you expand a imagePath:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center">
		<img src="../../files/images/CKFinder_imagePath_loading.png" width="143" height="113" alt="imagePath loading in CKFinder" />&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		The label will automatically disappear once all requested imagePaths are loaded.</p>
